# Wander

A tiny map app demonstrated three ways:

1. A React front-end with an Elixir Phoenix backend.
2. A full-stack Next.js app.
3. A full-stack Phoenix app with LiveView.

These implementations are only a starting point. There is more work to be done
to grow them into fully featured, production ready applications.

The main goal of this project is to make clear the differences between a plain
React front-end and a Next.js application.

The React implementations are complemented by a third in Phoenix LiveView with
a bit of vanilla JavaScript, to show a different approach.
